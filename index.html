	     <h1> The purpose of this website </h1>		 
		 <p> This website aims to give a better understanding of the nature of misinformation by
          explaining its causes and effects. It also aims to encourage others to be wary of it by enumerating the
          benefits to the minimization of misinformation. </p>

         <h1> What is misinformation? </h1> 
		 <p> Misinformation, as defined by Merriam-Webster, is "incorrect or misleading information" </p>
		 </section>
		 
		 <section>
		 <h1> What causes it to spread? </h1>
		 <p> To answer this question, we must talk of the motivation behind spreading misinformation and the means. People may be motivated to spread misinformation to paint a certain group 
		 in a good or bad light, perhaps in order to eke out some edge against said group. Alternatively, people may simply believe that the misinformation they're spreading is true, and 
		 genuinely have good, if misplaced, intentions. These motivations are further compounded by social media, giving anyone with a social media account the means by which to implant an idea into
		 people of all communities. Down below is the full essay.</p>

		 <h1> What are its effects? </h1>
		 <p> Misinformation, at the very best of days, leads to false accusations and irrational beliefs. At the very worst, it can function as propaganda, which leads to extreme and 
         unjustified hate and prejudice, which may be translated into violent action. Down below is the full essay. </p>

		 <section>
		 <h1> Benefits of the minimization of misinformation </h1>

		 <h1> Conclusion </h1>
		 <p> Misinformation helps to foster turmoil and irrationality within large swathes of the human populace. Due to this, people must be more skeptical of the information they find on the internet,
         as it is completely feasible that said information is false. Down below is the full essay. </p>
